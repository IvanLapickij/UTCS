A prototype **management system** for UrbanTech Co-Working Spaces, developed by a team of six.  
During the *Certificate in Software Engineering (Level 8) summer course*, delivered by **TUS (Technological University of Shannon – Midlands Athlone)**, **Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet**, and **Ericsson**.  
The system was designed to replace paper-based processes with a modern IT solution for **workspace reservations, member management, and financial reporting**.

## 🚀 Contributions  
As part of a **team of six developers**, I contributed significantly to the successful delivery of the UTCS prototype:  

- 👥 **Team Collaboration** – worked in an Agile environment across 2 sprints, using Jira for task tracking and GitHub/Bitbucket for version control  
- 💺 **Developed Functional Booking System** – implemented workspace reservation flow, including date/time selection and PayPal payment integration  
- 🔐 **Secure Login** – designed and implemented role-based access (Member, Admin, Management) with session validation  
- 💬 **User Feedback & UX** – built clear, intuitive PrimeFaces UI components with consistent layouts and real-time validation messages  
- 🧪 **Testing & Quality Assurance** – created automated unit tests with **JUnit**, achieving **80%+ code coverage** to ensure robustness and maintainability  
- 📈 **Scalability Considerations** – ensured system design could support future expansion (e.g., café service integration)
